# Using Artificial Intelligence Algorithms To Develop An Intelligent System

The topic of our project is to create an intelligent system using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.
In specific, our main goal is to create an intelligent game; player versus computer (=AI algorithm); computer versus computer and make the computer “smart” enough so it could potentially beat the human player using AI.
We will use technologies such as Unity development platform and AI algorithms for decision making and resource management.
